Hello Mister Euler,

I am a big fan of your work.
I am contacting you to help me solve a tremendously tough problem:
Does french people should say "une chocolatine" or "un pain au chocolat" to name what is defined by "a type of viennoiserie sweet pastry consisting of a cuboid-shaped piece of yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or two pieces of dark chocolate in the center." ?

Thanks for your advices and counsel.
I hope to meet you some day.

Sincerly yours.
